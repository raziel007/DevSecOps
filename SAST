Steps
Update Ubuntu VM

Configure Ubuntu VM to enable GIT CLI:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
Clone OWASP Juice Shop

Clone the repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git
cd juice-shop
cd frontend  # This will limit the scope of testing
Install Docker on Ubuntu VM

Use these guides to install Docker on a fresh VM (will also need curl):

Take a snapshot of the VM.
How to Run Static Application Security Testing with HoruSec
Set up your environment:

Use a virtual machine (e.g., VirtualBox).
Refer to the official tutorial for setup instructions.
Choose a target application:

For this example, we're using the OWASP Juice Shop (a deliberately vulnerable application).
Clone the repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git
Navigate to the target directory:

Use the cd command to enter the cloned repository:
cd juice-shop
cd frontend
Install and run HoruSec:

Clone the HoruSec repository:
git clone https://github.com/ZupIT/horusec.git
Install HoruSec:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZupIT/horusec/main/deployments/scripts/install.sh | bash -s latest
Use Docker to run HoruSec:
sudo docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-v $(pwd):/src/horusec \
horuszup/horusec-cli:latest horusec start -p /src/horusec -P $(pwd) --config-file-path=/src/horusec/horusec-config.json
Analyze the results:

Review the summary of vulnerabilities found.
Examine specific issues, including:
Language of the vulnerable code.
